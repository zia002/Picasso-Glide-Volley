This Android project uses Picasso to display images from user-provided links and Glide with Volley to automatically load and display memes from an API.<br>
This Android app demonstrates two approaches to image loading:<br>
1. **Picasso Integration**: Users can provide an image URL, and Picasso is used to load and display the image directly in the app. This feature allows users to easily view any image they link to.<br>
2. **Glide with Volley Integration** The app also fetches and displays random memes from an API. Using Volley, the app sends a network request to retrieve a meme URL, and Glide is then used to load and display the image efficiently. This combination ensures a smooth and responsive experience when displaying dynamic content. 
This project highlights the flexibility of using different image loading libraries in Android, catering to both static user inputs and dynamic content fetching.
